<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm currently employed full-time as a consultant electrical engineer. I work with clients in the public and private sector 
to provide EC&I outline, FEED and detailed design solutions for large scale renewable energy and nuclear decomissioning projects.</p>
<p>Having studied electrical and electronic engineering at university, I completed several module projects in 
advanced electronic, robotics and automation systems. These projects mainly used microcontroller boards (Arduino and ARM), that were programmed
using C/C++ within a proprietary IDE. These microcontroller projects were a huge highlight from my time in university and I've been hoping
to explore different programming applications ever since.</p>
